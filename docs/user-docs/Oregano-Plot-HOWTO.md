Oregano - Plot
==============


Start
-----

The Oregano - Plot is started automatically after you hit
"Run a simulation" (F5) and the netlist has been created successfully
and ngspice simulation has completed successfully.


Plot
----

There are 2 options how the black screen can be filled with functions.

1. **Nodes**<br>
Electical potentials existing at the defined voltage clamps can be
plotted by opening the "Nodes"-tree and checking the checkboxes.
2. **Functions**<br>
If you want to plot something like voltage between two potentials,
you can do this by defining a "Substraction"-Function by clicking
at "File"->"Add Function" in the menubar. The dialog is pretty intuitive.
After adding the function by cklicking on the "Add"-buttion, the
new function is appearing in the "Function"-tree and can be plotted
by activating the checkbox.


Zoom in
-------

Zooming in is supported by defining a "positive" zoom rectangle. The
upper left corner of the rectangle is defined by clicking and holding
the left mouse button. The lower right corner of the rectangle is defined
by moving the mouse (while holding the left mouse button) to the lower
right corner and releasing the left mouse button there.


Zoom out
--------

You can zoom out by resetting the view.


Resetting the view
------------------

You can reset the view by defining a "negative" zoom rectangle
(see also "Zoom in").
